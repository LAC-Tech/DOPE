# DOPE
Declarative Prototype Object Extension
    
Features:
- Prototype based, no distinction between classes and instances.
- Multiple inheritance, methods are looked up in depth first search
- Declarative syntax, can create an object with a single macro, no need to clone
  and mutate
- Immutable objects, which can be inherited by and inherit from mutable ones

Examples are at the end of the file (I follow a javascript object tutorial)
